# Cell-Anamoly-Detection-using-Autoencoders
Our cell anomaly detection project uses an autoencoder to identify abnormal cell images by learning to reconstruct normal ones. Anomalies are flagged based on high reconstruction error and low likelihood in latent space (using Kernel Density Estimation), providing a reliable system for detecting unusual cells.
